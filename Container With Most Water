Problem Statement: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxarea = 0
        x = 0
        y = len(height) - 1
        while x != y:
            length = min(height[x], height[y])
            width = y - x
            area = length * width
            if maxarea < area:
                    maxarea = area
            if height[x] < height[y]:
                x += 1
            else:
                y -= 1
        return maxarea
